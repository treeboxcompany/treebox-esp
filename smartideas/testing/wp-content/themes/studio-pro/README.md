3. Search and replace `Studio Pro` with your theme name.

You can also use the Gulp [rename](#additional-commands) task included with the theme.

## Development

Studio Pro uses [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) as a build tool and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to manage front-end packages.

### Install dependencies

From the command line on your host machine, navigate to the theme directory then run `npm install`:

```shell
# @ themes/your-theme-name/
$ npm install
```

You now have all the necessary dependencies to run the build process.

### Build commands

* `gulp styles` — Compile, autoprefix and minify Sass files.
* `gulp scripts` — Minify javascript files.
* `gulp images` — Compress and optimize images.
* `gulp watch` — Compile assets when file changes are made, start Browsersync
* `gulp` — (Default task) runs all of the above tasks.


#### Additional commands

* `gulp i18n` — Scan the theme and create `languages.pot` POT file.
* `gulp zip` — Package theme into zip file for distribution, ignoring `node_modules`.
* `gulp bump` - Bumps version number in all files. See options in example below.
  - `--major` version when you make incompatible API changes
  - `--minor` version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner
  - `--patch` version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes
  - `--to` allows you to define a custom version number, e.g. `gulp bump --to 0.1.0`
* `gulp rename` - Rename theme Title, Text Domain and Function Prefix.
  - `--to` name for your theme e.g: `gulp rename --to your-theme-name`


### Using Browsersync

To use Browsersync you need to update the proxy URL in `gulpfile.js` to reflect your local development hostname.

If your local development URL is `my-site.dev`, update the file to read:

```javascript
...
  proxy: 'my-site.dev',
...
```

By default, BrowserSync is configured to use a HTTP connection. If you are using an SSL certificate for local development uncomment the HTTPS settings and change the proxy URL accordingly.
